    "# Amortized Posterior Estimation for Simple Agent-Based Model\n",
    "**Vicsek Model in BayesFlow** \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate amortized posterior estimation for a simple agent-based model (ABM). ABM is of interest because it is inherently hierarchical, but the interaction between agents does not always lead to tractable mathematical formulation. In addition, the resulting formulation can be either vague, involving little to no equations, or extremely complex, involving a large amount of parameters and equations, making meaningful inference difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural surrogates have proven to be one of the promising approaches for extracting model parameters for ABM. As an example, we use BayesFlow for the posterior estimation for a simple ABM: the [Vicsek model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicsek_model). The model, which characterizes the dynamic of collective motion, has found numerous applications from simulating active Brownian particles, from modeling social dynamics.\n",

    "* $\\theta_{j, t}, \\theta_{i, t}$ is the heading direction of agent $j$ and $i$ at a given time $t$. Here, $i$ is the neighboring agent of $j$ within a perception distance $r$;\n",
    "* $\\eta_{j, t-1} \\sim \\mathcal{U}(-\\mu_j, \\mu_j)$ is a rotational noise for agent $j$. In addition to uniform sampling, this noise can also be sampled from  Gaussian or von Mises distributions;\n",
